# Stochastic Optimization

## Installation

### Python environment

python 3.10.0 is used to run this project. Dependencies and packaging are handled with Poetry (1.1.11).

You might need to run some of the following commands to install the project:
```bash
# Install poetry
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | POETRY_VERSION=1.1.11 python -

# Update poetry version
poetry self update 1.1.11

# Enable poetry to install the venv at the root of the project dir
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# Check which version of python is used
poetry env info

# Change python version
poetry env use /path/to/python3.10.0
```

Install the packages dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

You can run any python script locally with
- `poetry run python my_script.py`: for any python script
- `poetry run sto my_command`: for any command registered in `stochastic_optimization/__main__.py`


### pre-commit hooks

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is used to manage git hooks. You need to install the hooks into your local repo:

```shell
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Gurobi
The [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) solver is used to solve our optimization problems here. Gurobi is a paid solver, and we're interacting with it via the [`gurobipy`](https://pypi.org/project/gurobipy/) package that includes a **trial** license (limited to small problem size). This is enough for this sandbox project.

If you're willing to fork this project and play with larger problem instances you might need to ask/pay for a proper license, or rewrite the code to use a solver-agnostic package (e.g. [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/)) with an open-source solver (e.g. [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)).

### [Solving Simple Stochastic Optimization Problems with Gurobi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb4a8T5qyVQ)

[![Solving Simple Stochastic Optimization Problems with Gurobi](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Jb4a8T5qyVQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb4a8T5qyVQ)

A nice introduction to stochastic problems, using a pratical example with the newsvendor problem. Main focus is on the choice of an objective function (expected loss, value at risk, conditional value at risk)

**Reading notes:**

> - Simple algorithms rely on sampling: quick practical convergence in many cases. Relies on old deterministic techniques, but problem size can increase a lot
> - Focus on the news vendor problem: Decide how much inventory to buy today, sell tomorrow depending on (stochastic) demand.
> - Description of 2-stage problems:
>   - First stage decision: make a decision before the stochasticity is revealed to you. Cannot depend on the realization of the random variable.
>   - Second stage variable: can depend on the random variable (e.g. how much quantity you're going to scrap tomorrow).
> - How do we valuate uncertain outcome (maybe expected value, what about risk?).
> - Maximizing the expectation for continuous random variables leads to infinite dimension (how do I integrate?). For discrete variable, it's just a very large LP: `E[x] = ∑ p_i * x_i`
> - Other objective functions:
>   - Maybe we want to limit exposure to bad cases. What about maximizing worst case return? It's still an LP, but can be too conservative.
>   - Maybe worth optimizing the 25th worst value. It is called the VAR-75% (value at risk). It becomes a chance constraint problem (*it becomes a "bad" MIP, need to track every-scenario - not sure to have understood why*)
>   - Conditional value at risk = the average of the tail distribution (not only the exact VAR-a point): `CVaR_a[Ω] = E[Ω | Ω ≥ VaR_a[Ω]]`
> - formulation of the value at risk:
>   - `CVaR_a[Ω] = min t + E[|Ω-t|+] / (1 - a)`
>   - This allows for simple optimization and constraints
> - You can do custom CVaR objectives: (50% of CVaR-75% + 50% expected)
> - Choosing constraints / objectives can help shape the resulting distribution.
> - With continuous variables: sampling is enough under most general conditions. "Sample average approximation method". `Z(x*) ≥ Zp ≥ E[Zp^]`


### [Stochastic and dynamic programming - ENSTA Paris Saclay](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~leclerev/OptimizationSaclay.html)

University course covering both stochastic programming and dynamic progamming. I only focused on the former. Completes well the Gurobi webinar & has some practical exercises.

**Reading notes:**

> - There is a closed form result for the news-vendor problem
> - Carefuly think of your objective: in some cases the expectation is not really representative of your risk attitude
> - Stochastic constraints: `g(u,Ω) < 0, P−as`
>  - Deterministic version: `g(u,Ω) < 0 for all Ω` can be extremely conservative, and even often without any admissible solutions. (e.g. if `Ω` is unbouded -e.g. Gaussian- no control `u` is admissible).
>  - A few possible options:
>    - Service-level like constraint: `E[g(u,Ω)] < 0`
>    - Chance-constraint `P(g(u, Ω) < 0) ≥ 1 - eps` ( butdoesn't tell you what happens when the constraint is not satisfied)
>    - `CVaR-a[g(u,Ω)] < 0`

### [Optimisation robuste: faire face au pire cas](http://www.roadef.org/journee_aquitaine/pdf/IMB_RO.pdf)

Quite different from the other ones. Focus on robust optimization: optimizing under the worst-case scenario (thus removing the notion of stochasticity).

**Reading notes:**

> - Difference stochastic vs. robust optimization
>   - Stochastic optimization: Experience run several times, no major risk in case of "bad" realization of the random effect.
>   - Robust optimization: Immunity against the worst uncertain events.
> - Worst-case basic approach (too simplistic): in practice you protect yourself against impossible events… to the detriment of the economic quality of the solution.
> - Uncertainty budgeting approach: improvement of the worst-case basic approach
>   - parameters can vary within a range.
>   - at most `T` parameters will vary (`T` = "uncertainty budget")
>   - look-up for solutions with optimal cost, that are still feasible under this set of deviations.
> - Example of the robust knapsack


### [Stochastic optimization and learning - a unified framework](https://castlelab.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Powell_StochOptandLearningJan072018.pdf)

Very complete textbook on stochastic optimization with various flavours (stochastic programming, optimal control, dynamic programming, online learning, multiarm bandits, etc.). Didn't have time to properly dig into it, but I'll keep it in mind for future reference.
